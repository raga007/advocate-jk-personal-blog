When the music wise ilayaraja starts his van fame " Shiva Shakti Shakti Shakti Shakthal " janani janani " song with soundarya " song, no need to know Tamil, it is enough to know Tamil, it is enough to enjoy the music. But only for me, the song of joy, always gives a little bit of joy.

The first love of cinema. If there is a tumkur theater to cross over the seven mountains and seven seas, to destroy thousands of radshers and many strange animals, rather than to marry a prince in the iron fort, which is beyond the crocodile, I felt so blessed to see a movie.

Amma (me and my younger brother Shankar) sent us (me and my younger brother Shankar) for taking the first mark of "Mother Mookambika" which was running in the seventh standard annual exam. Bench before 65 money add 1.35 Add Cushion to balcony for two rupees tickets. On the way to the theater, he said, "I was angry with my wonderful propossessed by saying," I will not end up for 65 money tickets without talking

Since the movie is super hit, we became in the theater at 4 pm for 630 pm. Since there was a lot of time to open the ticket counter, we saw a small crowd under a tree which was near the theatre gate. And we both went near, that the vain, to attract us. In the midst of the noise crowd, a man sat before him, sitting on a small stage and moving three cards in his hand. In the three cards, two were empty, and only one was with the joker. He was changing the three cards at lightning speed, and too much. We understood the game very well in a while watching. Double amount of money on the joker card in the cards he has changed. Money out if you put it on the empty card.

And one who was by our side said to us, " Brothers, you are wise to see. Tie it once, you will surely win And we do not know that he is an illusion. When I said, " Shankar, we will make two rupees, even if we go, we can watch the movie in 65 money ticket he said that the head of the head of the head and shankar is correct. We both noticed very much. I put two rupees on the card which I decided to be this card. Just a card if you turn a card. Alas, two rupees out. I don't know what to do. The only riot within me. The deer again said to me, " hurry up. Do not worry, this time, I put a small lap on the corner of the joker card, and you build it As said, the uncle put a lap. In that moment, my body was filled with all my body to catch what I had left. Again Lightning speed shuffle. Now I'm pretty sure, I put two remaining on that fold card. If you return. Empty card again. The whole thing is govinda. (I understood that he balanced the lap from the joker card at the joker card, and folded the same on empty ticket, and I understood that the magic of this mangatha is the demon).

What to do??? Both of them did not understand anything, failing anger and three cards, and three cards, to hold the panic about the skin, and when both of them were crying out of them were not doing, " you are not sitaraman boys??? Heard a voice. When he turned back, an image that had a skin for the bone was surprised to see, and it reminded me of tillana mohanlal. " I am the cuppuni. Your Father friend. I am server at railway station irr. I was watching everything. Well, come on, I'm going to get a ticket and he appeared to us as a great man without peacock.

No one else could have seen that picture with such fear than the two of us. For the whole picture, we watched the movie while we both were asking for the mother mookambi to tell his father tomorrow. When the movie was over, he said to him, " Uncle, thank you very much. We will never forget this help. But when he asked him, "a small request, please do not tell me this thing and he said to him," how much did your father has done to me

One week later, one day, when our father came to know the whole thing, as sitaraman had given us up with his name sitaraman, and the lines that he put on his belt on the back, and it has been a long time to hide.

Later one day, I saw the eight cup that serves in irr canteen with dad. This time he appeared to my eyes as a black group. And when he was yelling, he said to him, "why do you put your father," why do you put it down how much did your father do to me
