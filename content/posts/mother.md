Is it mother only if you get it...

Every night I came through the face of satya test mudaliar shop. In the cruelty of kathiri heat, two extra Jill beer is one side of eating beer. On the other side of our man's side, looking at the other side of our man's neighbor's side. In the midst of this, like a lizard, like a lizard that was stuck in the door, for a five rupees al-pa pet, I went to sleep 100 kg of corn, and my spine was broken with the sound of rain.

Can't wake up the next morning. Vasu, " nothing dude. The double omelette was the reason to eat valli mesla yesterday and bought 10 gasex. The whole room is full of hydrogen peroxail. Even infant couldn't move, this is not a cass problem, after knowing it was disc prolapse, I came to chennai anyway.

How much treatment. How much prayer. I became admit to operations in cover hospital because it does not benefit of rainbow color pills, heating pad therapy, physiotherapy, traction, etc. In the morning, cat hairs were shaved all night for the morning, and the gospel of God came through the nurse. I will tell you a doctor, " no need for spine operation at this age Go and see him, he gave the address of dr.i.s.shanmugam A hope that is legal. In Case, what happened with one Shawn face will happen only by another shun face???

As a night, he escaped from there, and the next day the doctor was his wife. Saw at the city clinic. One Basket of anger, lakhs of basket talent, one amazing doctor. He dropped me on the study stage and put a needle on the split disc side. Then he took a coat of the magic, and put a blaster of Paris banner from Mari to the waist. After 21 days later, come back to control He said we can do all the work except for taking bath He told him to keep lying as much as possible. The body is inside the blaster tower, but the confidence is at the feet of the doctor.

When I came home, a yellow color cover post was found at the door. If you read divided, there was a bisical test for the central excess inspector work in two days, Madurai. 8 KM CYCLING AND 4 km fast walking. Don't know whether to cry or laugh.

When he told the doctor, he asked if I get an extension I said it is very difficult. He said, "worry, let's do it", That day, he doesn't seem to be my doctor. Kalki looked like an avatar. When the day of departure was near, there was a stranger movie in me, and here is the horror that the horror, and a stranger movie was stle

Reserve is not available in pandian express as the end of may. I went early and lay down where my dad had made a towel to bed and prepared for me to bed. Perfect crowd on the train. About 30 people around me were sitting in that place and sat down. Then in the crowd, a mother with a flower basket said to me, " why do you not know? We are thinking that this name is difficult. You stay lying down. She woke me up I also called that was right. Woke up hard and sat on a side.

When Tambaram crossed tambaram, when I woke up to go to rest room, my blaster drum was thrown down to the mother. To hear " what happened brother, what happened I told the story. What happened next I was just unexpected. She made me a place for her eyes," and she said, King, forgive me without knowing the heat," but she made me a place and spread her bed with her clothes. Not just that. Since that apartment fan was not roaming, the mother came to me with her saree without sleeping.

The train journey ended in madurai. After that the journey of my life has come a long distance. But as long as I remember, my heart will not forget that mother...\
I am making this post for crores of mothers like this.

Happy Mother 's Day...
